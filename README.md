## Project Ideas

* Workout Song Sorter (please suggest a better name)

Application that organizes songs in an order that fits the user's workout routine intensity. The app will sync with the user's Spotify account, pull in songs from playlists, and sort them depending on the intensity of the workout, which will be determined by the user. The user will also create tags (a playlist for a specific exercise) to determine which songs should be played during certain workout times/activities. For example, if the user is going for a light jog with sporadic sprints, during the jog the app will pick songs from their jog tag and when it's time for the user to start sprinting the app will change to their sprint/running tag. 
The user will also need to log in some personal information when they start using the app, such as their age and what activities they usually do, and they will be given the option to log onto Facebook/Twitter and share their tags with their friends. 
The app will also be able to recommend different songs based off the user's favorite artists/songs (some API database).
